# Car Acceptability Predictor

Predict Whether the Car is Acceptable after the servicing period, so there are 4 measures for this Good, Perfect, Acceptable, and Unacceptable. Basically, after we purchase a car, we have to give our car for servicing, and then if there are any defects or anything of that kind, post servicing we can get it and see whether it is acceptable or not. Even we can consider after manufacturing and before getting into production, whether the car is well acceptable by people in the public or not.
