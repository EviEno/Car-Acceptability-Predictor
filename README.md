# Dog Breed Prediction

In this project, we will see how to use Keras and TensorFlow to build, train, and test a convolutional neural network capable of identifying a dog's breed in a supplied image. This is a supervised learning problem, precisely a multiclass classification problem.

### TimeLine of the Project
- Load the data into data from Kaggle.
- load labels csv for labels that contain images id and breed
- checking the breed count
- one-hot encoding on labels data prediction column
- load the images, convert them to an array, and normalize them
- checked the shape and size of the x and y data
- building the model network architecture
- split the data and fit it into the model and create an accurate plot
- evaluate the model for accuracy score
- using the model for prediction
